<h2>Attending a Memtech Meetup Like a Pro</h2>
<h3>Don't Go In Cold</h3>
<p>The best thing you can do to make sure your Memtech meetup experience is a success is to not go in cold. By joining the Memphis Technology Slack you'll gain access to a dedicated Slack channel for each of our meetups where you'll be able to conversate with attendees before the meetup even starts. As an added bonus you'll be able to ask any question you think of after the meetup ends. You join our Slack by clicking the <strong>CHAT WITH US</strong> link in the navigation or clicking the link below.</p>

<h3>Remember We're Friendly</h3>
<p>Memtech is an open and inviting community that works hard to make sure everyone feels welcome. Walking into a room full of strangers can be nerve racking, especially when imposter syndrome gets involved, but Memtech meetups are full of friendly people who want you to say hello. We are a living community who needs new members to stay alive. We need you and we want to talk to you, so say "Hello!"</p>

<h3>Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Our meetups cover a large range of topics. Not every meetup is going to include code that you can copy and paste into your work code base to fool you boss into thinking you did a week of work. Some will, but not all. Even if the meetup your attending isn't full of skills you plan on ever using, pay attention. You never know when the context will be useful or your career path might shift.</p>

<h3>Attendance Is Appreciated</h3>
<p>I am the organizer of MemphisPHP. The only compensation I, and every other Memtech organizer, receives is your support. It means a lot to us when you show up and enjoy the events we work hard to put on.</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3>
